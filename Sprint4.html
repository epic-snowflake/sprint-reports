<h2>Summary of the Project</h2>
<p>Epic Snowflake is attempting to create an event RSVP web application that
allows Yale studends add events to the app happening locally on campus.
Some of its features include restricting RSVPing to Yale students by email extention,
and compliling a complete list of all events happening on campus.</p>

<p>As this chart makes clear, our velocity is not very consistent. We think this is mainly because some of our story 
point estimations are off. This was something we discussed this week that we need to revisit in our next sprint 
planning meeting. As we learn more about the project and more about our skill level we are able to better estimate 
our stories. However, sometimes we are still using old estimations from the first week of the project that we now 
realize are not accurate. Another reason our velocity varies is because depending on the week, team members are able 
to spend more or less time on the project. Looking at our velocity is useful, however, because it helps us determine 
how much we can take on in the next week, and when we are over or under ambitious it is helpful to look back and say we 
should either push ourselves or be more realistic about our schedules.

<h2>Stories we completed: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Event-detail pages </li>
        <li> Form for creating new events - should display errors to the user when the image is not a URL </li>
        <li> Form for creating new events - should display errors to the user when the image is not a gif or png </li>
        <li> Fully-functional submit button </li>
        <li> New event creation page should have appropriate options for the select elements </li>
        <li> Each event should have its own details page</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Sprint Backlog: </h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Event Details Page - should reject RSVPs from Harvard addresses</li>
    <li>The Event Details Page - should allow Yale users to RSVP</li>
    <li>Re-evaluation of the above two stories and their division into smaller well defined tasks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Product Backlog:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Form for creating new events - should redirect the user to the event detail page if the form is valid</li>
        <li> Sketch Design of Homepage</li>
        <li> Sketch Design of Event #0 page</li>
        <li> Sketch Design of Homepage</li>

<h2>Summary of Sprint</h2>

<p>
This week we had similar issues to last, in which we underestimated the effort needed to complete some stories. 
For example one of our stories was to accept and reject specific emails on the RSVP 
form based on email extension. Thinking this was going to be a simple string check, 
we only assigned this story three points. Only when Venky started working on this 
story did we realize it would actually involve creating a new form and adding more HTML 
elements. Though this was an unfortunate aspect of our week, it was the only negative we 
discussed in our retrospective. Our positives included Amanda and Paul's cohesion in getting the 
url .gif/.jpg test to work. Both were excited by how quickly they were able to complete that story. 
Alexandra's major positive was understanding more of the back-end of submitting events which included 
getting the submit button to function properly. A positive for the entire group is that we are very efficient. 
Now that we are having our in-class meeting on Mondays, we often do not need to meet to do our sprint planning 
that evening. Additionally, our retrospective and sprint report meeting is going very quickly.
</p>
<p>
Paul created events detail pages based on ID, complete will all the required information for each event.
As stated in the retrospective, Alexandra was able to fully understand the submit buttonâ€™s functionality, which 
allowed Paul to add an "id" field to the "saveEvent" function to make sure that our new events had event detail pages 
that were accessible. Paul also worked with Amanda on two tests checking the url of event images - and almost finished 
form validation! During the retrospective, Paul felt the main negative of the week was that stories were under and 
overestimated (as described below). He suggested in our next sprint planning meeting (tomorrow) that we re-estimate 
the remaining stories and add more stories to break up the RSVP section and include the new tests added from the stakeholders. 
</p>

<p>
Specifically in terms of the RSVP functionality, this sprint we assigned 6 story points divided between two tasks. 
However, after consultation with one of the stakeholders (David) Venky informed the team and we realized that as a 
team we had severely underestimated these tasks and their associated story points. Thereafter, we practiced agile 
methodologies and further divided the two tasks into multiple smaller tasks and re-evaluated and re-assigned their 
story points. We did start working on these new tasks mid-sprint. For instance, Venky created the functionality to 
select if one is attending the event or not. However, some of them are still in progress as they are more complex 
than we anticipated in comparison to the others. In sum, regular communication with the stakeholders inside and 
outside the classroom helped the team adjust and adapt to the advanced workload mid-sprint in an effective and agile manner.

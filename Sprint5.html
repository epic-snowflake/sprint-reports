<h2>Epic-Snowflake</h2>
<p>30th November 2015</p>
<h2>Member Names and Emails</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Paul Styslinger - paul.styslinger@yale.edu</li>
    <li>Venkatesh Jindal - venkatesh.jindal@yale.edu</li>
    <li>Amanda Roberts - amanda.roberts@yale.edu</li>
    <li>Alexandra Torresquintero - alexandra.torresquintero@yale.edu</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary of the Project</h2>
<p>Epic Snowflake is attempting to create an event RSVP web application that
allows Yale studends add events to the app happening locally on campus.
Some of its features include restricting RSVPing to Yale students by email extention,
and compliling a complete list of all events happening on campus.</p>

<h2>Burndown Charts</h2>

<h4>Long-term Velocity</h4>
    <div class="center-block">
        <img src="sprint5velocity.png" class="img-responsive" height="500" width="800">
    </div><br/>
    <p>Our velocity chart looks almost disappointing, especially seeing that we had an
    additional week for this sprint. However it is important to remember that our team
    is (as shown repetitively) not good at story estimation. And, as shown in our burndown
    chart, despite the fact that we began this sprint with fewer story points than in the
    past, we actually added more points throughout the sprint. Bearing these improvements
    in mind, as well as the fact that we completed more stories in sprint 5 than our list
    sprint, we can agree that our velocity chart should not be as disheartening as it
    appears on the surface.</p>

<h4>Daily Burndown</h4>    
    <div class="center-block">
        <img src="sprint5burndown.png" class="img-responsive" height="500" width="800">
    </div><br/>
    <p>Looking at our daily burndown chart, we can see that many of stories were completed
    earlier in the week. As mentioned above, another story was added on November 28th but
    unfortunately not completed by the end of the sprint. Alexandra decided to try to add
    an icon to the site after the RSVP functionality was completed. She plans to meet with
    the TAs later this week to get this working properly. While we did not complete all of
    our points for the sprint, we did get through the vast majority, as we have plans for
    the upcoming week to finish the remaining stories (robot clicks and tab icon).</p>

    

<h2>Stories we completed: </h2>

<h2>Summary of Sprint</h2>

    <p>This sprint saw our completion of the assigned tests. We talked in our
    retrospective about how this really boosted our moral, as now for the rest of
    the semester we get to work on aesthetic - functionality is completed. Our one
    negative was the fact that we underestimated (yet again!) the size of a story.
    This time it was the google analytics experiment. Paul did manage to get google
    analytics setup and running, but now the tests for click-through rate (based on
    the presence of the RSVP button and a donate/support event) are stumping us.
    Amanda will go to office hours later this week to try and get this functioning
    properly.</p>
    
    <p>Amanda put in a lot of great work to create wireframes for the Homepage and
    About pages - we’ll also use part of the home page as a template the event details
    pages. Over the next week, we’ll use these wireframes as a basis for our CSS work.
    These are shown in the images below.</p>


<h4>Homepage Wireframe</h4>
    <div class="center-block">
        <img src="home_page.png" class="img-responsive" width="50%">
    </div>
<hr>
<h4>About Page Wireframe</h4>
    <div class="center-block">
        <img src="about_page.png" class="img-responsive" width="50%">
    </div>
    
    
    
<p>Paul added the google analytics code to the website and played around with how
the program works; this upcoming week, we’ll get the experiment and analysis going.
He also worked on merging some of the branches to make all of our tests pass, and helped
Alexandra fix her computer (it’s always broken :/)
</p>

<p>For this Sprint Venky worked on passing all the RSVP tests. These included allowing
Yale users to RSVP and rejecting non-Yale email addresses. In particular, he states the
he found Kyle’s videos really helpful in truly understanding how the RSVP code functioned.
Moreover, he stated that the function to validate the RSVP was significantly harder in
comparison to the other RSVP stories assigned to him. Especially, throwing a different
error message when rejecting ‘harvard’ email addresses. However, the various relations
between the different aspects of code deepened his understanding of the overall code written
for the project as well as the functioning of HTML and JS in general.
</p>

<p>With the completion of the RSVP tests our team has now passed all tests! This we are all
really happy and excited about. We believe that our strong emphasis in religiously following
agile practices over the course of the semester has driven us to this comfortable position
where in most aspects we are ahead of where we anticipated we would be at this point, in the
beginning of the semester. Therefore, we are ready and motivated to make the best use of our
next and final sprint to truly deliver high quality software to our stakeholders. </p>

<h2>Summary of the Project</h2>

<p>As this chart makes clear, our velocity is not very consistent. We think this is mainly because some of our story 
point estimations are off. This was something we discussed this week that we need to revisit in our next sprint 
planning meeting. As we learn more about the project and more about our skill level we are able to better estimate 
our stories. However, sometimes we are still using old estimations from the first week of the project that we now 
realize are not accurate. Another reason our velocity varies is because depending on the week, team members are able 
to spend more or less time on the project. Looking at our velocity is useful, however, because it helps us determine 
how much we can take on in the next week, and when we are over or under ambitious it is helpful to look back and say we 
should either push ourselves or be more realistic about our schedules.

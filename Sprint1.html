<h2>Summary</h2>  
<p>At our first meeting in order to establish what we’re doing for the rest of the project,
we played planning poker to assign story points to everything in our todo list which became
our backlog. These stories included assigning scrum roles:
    <ul>
        <li>PO: Venky</li>
        <li>Scrum Master: Alexandra</li>
        <li>Team Members: Amanda and Paul</li>
    </ul>

and setup of accounts on Github, Heroku, Cloud9, and Waffle. We managed to complete 83 of our 88 points.</p>

<p>Finding a meeting time was slightly difficult, but we have since set up two weekly meeting
times. Completing these stories also took a very long time, and we did not really take into account
the points we assigned them or really assign stories to specific team members. Instead we all worked
on each of the stories together. We do not plan to do this in the future, and we deem these
hindrances as acceptable seeing as this was our first sprint.</p>

<p>Next week we will work on creating our product backlog, as that is the only story point in our
sprint one backlog. We will also begin wireframing to get an idea of the site's aesthetic. Before our
next sprint meeting we are meeting to have a sprint retrospective. This is when our scrum master,
Alexandra, will allow us to have an open and honest dialogue about how the first sprint went. After
this meeting we will then have our second sprint planning meeting and assign story points to each team
member.</p>

showing how we planned our first sprint. We will no longer be using google docs as we discoverd Waffle.</p>

<p>We created a separate GitHub repository for our spring reports. <a href="https://github.com/epic-snowflake/sprint-reports.git">
    Here</a> is the link for that.</p>

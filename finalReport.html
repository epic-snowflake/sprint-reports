<h2>Epic-Snowflake Final Report</h2>
<p>11th December 2015</p>
<h2>Member Names and Emails</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Paul Styslinger - paul.styslinger@yale.edu</li>
    <li>Venkatesh Jindal - venkatesh.jindal@yale.edu</li>
    <li>Amanda Roberts - amanda.roberts@yale.edu</li>
    <li>Alexandra Torresquintero - alexandra.torresquintero@yale.edu</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary of the Project</h2>
<p>Epic Snowflake is attempting to create an event RSVP web application that
allows Yale studends add events to the app happening locally on campus.
Some of its features include restricting RSVPing to Yale students by email extention,
and compliling a complete list of all events happening on campus.</p>

<h2>Analytics Summary</h2>
    <p>
        While at first we found Google Analytics difficult and confusing to implement and run experiments with, once we started to 
        understand how it worked, we found it really cool to play around with. The value of A/B testing is huge, and if we were to 
        continue this project it is something we would definitely want to do more of to make our site even more effective and efficient. 
    </p>
    
<h3>Questions:</h3>
<ul>1. How do different segments flow through the application?</ul>
     <br>
     <div class="center-block">
        <img src="userFlow.png" class="img-responsive" width="50%">
     </div>
     <br>
    
   <p> Below we list how the traffic breaks down across different segments and how they click through the website:</p>
        <ul><b>Landing to event details page:</b></ul>
        <li>SOM - 7.39% </li>
        <li>Div School - 5.58% </li>
        <li>Law School - 3.46% </li>
        <li>search.yale.edu - 1.82% </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul><b>Event details to donation page:</b>
        <li>SOM - go to /donation .407% of time </li>
        <li>Div School - .667% of time </li>
        <li>Law School - 5.13% </li>
        <li>Search.yale.edu - 33.3% </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        
        <p>Looking at this data, SOM students are more apt to click through to
        the event details page from the landing page, but interestingly enough it
        is search.yale.edu students who are more likely to click through to 
        donation page from the event detail page. This suggests that search.yale.edu
        students are more generous than other student bodies on campus.</p>
        
<ul>2. Does making the event links on the home page include the word "RSVP" would increase click-through rate?</ul>
    <br>
    <div class="center-block">
            <img src="rsvp.png" class="img-responsive" width="80%">
    </div>
    <br>
<p>Having the word "RSVP" on the links on the homepage, increased click-through rate. When there is a RSVP button, 
8.09% of users click. When there is no “RSVP” button there is click-through only 5.99% of the time. 
While this is only a small difference, we think it is notable enough to make a permanent change to use the RSVP button.</p>

<p>It is important to note that on December 9th, lack of an RSVP button was a higher 
motivator for click through rate to the event detail page. But this one day shift is probably due to the fact 
that this is fake traffic that is constantly being manipulated and thus this could have been a fluke just for
the day.</p>

<ul>3. Does asking people to "donate" or "support" an event in the the donation link text to increase conversions?</ul>
    <br>
    <div class="center-block">
            <img src="donate-support.png" class="img-responsive" width="80%">
    </div>
    <br>
<p>When "donate" was present, 6.06% wanted to donate, but when “support” was present, 4.11% of people clicked through. Looking at
the image above we see that while at the beginning of the week having "support" seemed to be better for click through rate
to our donation page, as of today (Friday), this has now switched to "donate". On Wednesday the 10th, Alexandra emailed Kyle
and the TAs asking about data for donate/support (as we were getting very little outside of our own), and Kyle said he would
update the traffic to send out clearer usage. This is when we see the shift on our graph, suggesting that our personal machines
were the primary data source before Wednesday, but after, the external users became that primary source.</p>

<ul> Thoughts on Project Maintenance: </ul>
    <p>
        If we were to pass this onto another team, we would want to share our thoughts on project maintenance with them. 
    If we had a database, we would want to give the new team access to that and let them know how it is structured, 
    so they do not mistakenly erase or delete anything. 
    Mainly, we learned that understanding git is crucial 
    to avoiding lots of miscommunication. Specifically, understanding when you start a new branch and make changes knowing 
    when to push those changes versus pull changes, understanding how to merge etc. We found that most of time during meetings, 
    in the early weeks, were spent merging and correcting changes. Also, we strongly advise following and practicing Scrum! 
    Especially, devoting adequate time each sprint planning meeting to discuss the previous sprint retrospective and to practice 
    "planning- poker" or another scrum equivalent when estimating and assigning story points. Hence, it is essential for the Scrum 
    Master to encourage a strict discipline within the team to practice Agile. In the long-term this will be deeply beneficial and make 
    life easier.  Moreover, practicing scrum in a disciplined manner improved our productivity and output each sprint resulting in 
    meeting deadlines early or on time, and greater communication within the team. Hence, over the course of the semester each of us 
    feels confident in our abilities to practice scrum in possible real life scenarios on the basis of our understanding of Agile methodologies.

<h2> New Features </h2>
<li>Month/day functionality - months with fewer than 31 days do not give day 31 as an option (Also, compensates for February 29th in 2016 since it's a leap year).</li>
<li>RSVP list looks nicer</li>
<li>instead of showing the RSVP list as a list of emails, jQuery parses through those strings and converts them into Firstname Lastname format.</li>
<li>We have an favicon in the tab in browsers that support this!</li>
<li>Navbar styling allowed for a nice navigation bar at the top of each page.</li>
<br>
<p>While we did not have a formal "Sprint 7" we did implement some new features since our final sprint report that we wanted to share with our stakeholders. 
We think these “nice to haves” were an amazing addition that we were lucky enough to have time to add and really took our site to the next level. 
The styling portion of the project was something our group had the most fun with and I think the look and feel of the site reflects that.</p>

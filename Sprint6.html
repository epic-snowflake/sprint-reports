<h2>Summary of the Project</h2>
<p>Epic Snowflake is attempting to create an event RSVP web application that
allows Yale studends add events to the app happening locally on campus.
Some of its features include restricting RSVPing to Yale students by email extention,
and compliling a complete list of all events happening on campus.</p>

<h2>Burndown Charts</h2>

<h4>Daily Burndown</h4>
    <div class="center-block">
        <img src="burndown6.png" class="img-responsive" height="500" width="800">
    </div><br/>
    <p>Our burndown chart this week is typical in the sense that Professor Jensen
    discussed a burndown chart often has a big bump in the beginning of the week.
    For us, this is because we realized how much more time and effort the stories
    were going to take than we had originally thought (the issue we have every week!).
    Mainly, the estimation of the Google Analytics work, which was originally one
    user story, was vastly undervalued. Alexandra broke this massive story into many
    smaller stories and this increased her original estimation from 7 points to 22
    points. Additionally, Paul and Venky realized their work on styling was going
    to be more than their allotted 8 points to 20 points.  Further adding to the bumpy
    nature of the chart, on thursday there was a miscommunication; Alexandra pushed a
    change about the Google Analytics that Paul overrode with his CSS changes.</p>

    <p>The only thing in our sprint backlog is getting the favicon.ico to work, which
    is represented by 2 story points still on the chart.</p>

    <p>Our product backlog is very light. We are going to work on fixing the experiment
    that is not generating data and continue to do some small touch ups on the styling.
    All the tests are passing.</p>

<h4>Long-term Velocity</h4>
    <div class="center-block">
        <img src="velocity6.png" class="img-responsive" height="500" width="800">
    </div><br/>
    <p>Our velocity the past three weeks has been fairly consistent. This is indicative
    of our team learning what is realistic to get done and also reassigning story points
    where it is necessary. While we still may underestimate in the beginning of the week,
    we are much quicker to reestimate when we realize how much work is going to be involved.</p>

<h2>Summary of Sprint</h2>
    <p>This week we focused on styling and google analytics. In our retrospective, we were happy overall
    with the work we accomplished; also, we felt that since this was our last sprint, we didn't need to
    focus as much on potential improvements (besides, there wasn't anything to complain about! We had a 
    brief meeting to talk about final touch-ups, but ultimately we're in good shape. The main issue we faced
    was after setting up google analytics, we were confused about how to implement the
    different experiments. Alexandra went to office hours and worked through this issue
    and set up the experiment to test the difference in traffic when the RSVP button was
    present and also the difference between the word "donate" and "support." However, we
    are still having a little difficulty here, because the RSVP button experiment is not
    generating data but it was created, which is why it is listed as a completed user story.</p>

    <p>Venky and Paul worked on CSS and the site is looking beautiful! They used Amanda's
    sketches from the sprint last week to offer guidance. Venky worked  on styling the Events
    detail and donation pages. The intensive crash course on CSS styling earlier this semester
    truly helped him, as he was able to understand and use bootstrap effectively. He did
    not really encounter and major problems while doing so. </p>
    
    <p>Paul mainly focused on the layout of "div" tags and prettifying forms and random
    elements with bootstrap. He also made the pictures show up along with the list of
    events and made them into nice-looking thumbnails. Color schemes, new images, and
    information on the about page were all added as well.</p>

    <p>In our next pseudo-sprint, before the final project is due, we are going to finish
    some small styling adjustments and make sure the experiment is actually generating
    data. Alexandra is planning on attending office hours again to correct this issue.</p>

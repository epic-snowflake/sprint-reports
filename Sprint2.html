<h2>Summary</h2>

<h4>Leftover from Sprint 1:</h4>
<p>We did not manage to have our sprint 1 retrospective before we submitted our sprint 1 report, so we will include our discussion there in this report. Our retrospective consisted of first stating negatives of the first sprint and discussing possible solutions, and then discussing positives of the first sprint. Our only negative was the fact that our first meeting was very very long. However we agreed together that this was for understandable reasons because it was the first meeting and we were still trying to figure everything out. We now know we will have two structured meetings per week: sprint planning at the beginning of the week, and the retrospective at the end. This structure (as well as the time limits imposed by it) should eliminate this issue.</p>
<p>	As for positives, we collectively agreed that our group thus far seems to be cohesive and have good communication. In particular, Amanda said that when one of us does not understand something, we are really good at helping each other out to make sure we can all progress together as a team. Venky added that our group doesn’t seem to have any weird awkwardness; we've just jumped right into the project smoothly. And Paul commented that we got a lot of work done! </p>


<h4>Sprint 2 Summary:</h4>
<p>After our sprint 1 retrospective, we had our second sprint planning meeting. First we worked on the only item on our sprint one backlog, which was the product backlog. This is why our burn down starts with 5 story points - they were left over from sprint 1. We completed those five points before beginning our sprint 2 planning meeting in which we added 76 more points. To create our product backlog, we added all of the tests as user stories to our Waffle account and then took turns ordering each story from what we felt would be easiest to hardest. Once we had an order we could all agree on, we then assigned story points to each user story. Next on our agenda was to decide what stories we wanted to assign to each team member. Realistically, we knew with only a two day sprint during Hallaweekend we couldn’t take on too much, as we are still figuring out our team's velocity. </p>
<p>A complete list of the stories we completed in this sprint is above, but in summary we managed to do a lot of work on the about page, the home page, and the create event page. </p>


<h4>Sprint 2 Retrospective:</h4>
<p>A main problem we ran into this week was Venky felt there was not enough direction to create sketches for the design of the website. We decided to not include this in our sprint, and instead he worked on passing the “about page” tests. We added these sketches to our sprint 2 backlog and will return to them when we have a better feel for what the stakeholders want for the style of the site. Positives this week include again that we feel we are very cohesive and helpful towards each other (Amanda needed help with the about page, and Venky was happy to take that on). We are also happy we managed to complete almost all of our assigned stories (minus the sketches). And finally, Venky said that “Paul is a savage” and we all collectively agree that he's a beast.</p>

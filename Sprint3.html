<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Every week we have held two scrum meetings. The first is on Sunday night to, first, hold
our sprint retrospective, and then to co-write our sprint report. In our retrospective we
discuss what went well and what we could work on for next week. Monday night we hold our
sprint planning meeting. Here we look at our velocity from the past weeks and decide how
much we think we can take on. In keeping with scrum, team members elect which user stories
they want to take on.</p>

<p>In our second week, we estimated the story points for each story in our product backlog.
To do this, we each took turns placing a story in an ordered list of least effort and time
to most. Then we rearranged the list until we were all satisfied with the order. With the
order in place, we discussed and assigned story points to each one. However, now that we
understand the scope of the project better and the abilities of our team members, we can
estimate the size of each story more accurately. During our sprint planning meeting, if
anything stands out as egregiously over or under estimated we discuss it as a group and
will change it if necessary. We considered changing the estimation for the two stories
involving the API, but decided against it, since we were ultimately unsure how much work
was really needed to be done. </p>

<p>The sprint backlog this week (what we intended to finish but were not able to) only
includes creating a submit button. This totals to one point, as indicated at the end of our
burn down chart. We were not able to complete this because we are still slightly confused
on how node.js works and using it to do backend/database things. At this point we do not
know if simply creating the button in HTML and getting it to actually work and post things
are two separate projects.</p>

<p>Our product backlog, which you can see in the link to our Waffle.io account, includes
the remaining tests we need to pass as well as creating sketches of each page of our site.
We have waited to start this process, because we want to have a better idea of what the
stakeholders envision for the look and feel of the application. </p>

<p>Our burndown chart this week most resembles the "Great Team" as defined by Dusan Kocurek
in the article, "Understanding the Scrum Burndown Chart." Kocurek explains this shape is to
be expected of "Experienced teams." As we complete our third week we definitely feel like
we are a more experienced team and are happy that our burn down chart represents that as
well. Kocurek also suggests this type of shape means the team should reevaluate the capacity
they are able to take on. In this case, however, I am not sure we could have taken more
work on, rather, our team is still figuring out how to work steadily throughout the sprint.
Different team memberâ€™s schedules allow them to work at different paces, and at times, take
on more of the work for their teammates. This has worked well as we can continue to keep
communication flowing throughout the team at all times on our GroupMe messenger. When someone
realizes they will not be able to complete their assigned story points, someone is always
there to take on the extra work. </p>

<p>The slight uptick in the beginning of the week, is from when Amanda was working on some
of the form tests. While watching the video, she realized that Professor Jensen preferred
we use a function, so as not to repeat ourselves, and ended up making more tests pass then
expected. This allowed Venky to take on more user stories than he expected and so midway
through the sprint he added 5 story points to his own work. </p>

<p>Additionally, Paul got the API up and running and implemented search with url queries, which was exciting.  </p>


<p>All in all, more tests were completed this week than we originally intended - as stated
above this is a good sign that our team is very productive.</p>
